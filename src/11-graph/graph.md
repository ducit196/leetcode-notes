### Topic

#### [Path finding](path-finding/path-finding.md)
Find path from source to target.  
Normally using DFS and BFS  
**Problem list:**  
797 - [All Paths From Source to Target](path-finding/797-all-path-source-target-bfs.py)

#### [Bipartite(Coloring)](bipartite/bipartite.md)
Bipartite graph is a graph that we can divide edges into 2 separate groups.  
Each group there is no connection between them.
